// Profile library: index, host-coherence scoring, and selection.
//
// The persona path this serves is `--fingerprint-profile` WITHOUT `--fingerprint`. That
// distinction is load-bearing and is why this module exists: measured against a strict
// anti-bot device check, a seed persona failed 13/13 while a profile-only persona passed. With no
// seed the farbling machinery never engages, so canvas/WebGL/audio readbacks come back
// byte-identical to an unmodified browser — the profile is static value substitution over a
// real, coherent capture rather than perturbation of this machine's.
//
// SELECTION IS ABOUT COHERENCE WITH *THIS HOST*, NOT ABOUT MATCHING AN OS STRING.
// A profile claiming an RTX 3080 on an Intel UHD host says NVIDIA in the strings and paints
// Intel pixels — a contradiction a detector reads in one call. So the GPU term dominates the
// score, and `browser_major` is a HARD filter: a Chrome-138 capture on a 150 engine reports
// UA 138 while the engine behaves like 150, which is self-contradictory in a way no scoring
// weight should be able to outvote.
//
// ROTATION IS PER-IDENTITY, NOT PER-LAUNCH. Always serving the single best profile makes every
// customer on similar hardware converge on one identity, and that shared fingerprint becomes its
// own signal. But re-rolling every launch is worse: an account whose device changes on every
// visit is a harder tell than a slightly-suboptimal stable one. So the default ("rotate") is
// sticky-per-key — same key always resolves to the same profile, different keys spread across
// the top-N.
